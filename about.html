                    <h3>Late 70s</h3><br><br>

                    
                    Whether Bowie was where the action was or the action was where David Bowie was, sometimes it is hard to assess, but either way the seismic plates of history were shifting under Berlin's Hansa Studio by the Wall during Bowie's 1976 sessions there. The iron curtain still firmly divided Europe and nowhere more so than in Berlin where David and Iggy were famously holed up. The subsequent music provided an atmospheric counterpoint to the emerging punk scene in London. David made a suitably mysterious return to the UK stage playing keyboards with Iggy in 1977, the bare bones production highlighting his unseen, all pervasive influence and fitting the mood of the times perfectly. It wasn't long, however, before Bowie was to step back out of the shadows once again.<br><br>
                    
                    Co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti in collaboration with Brian Eno, Low emerged in 1977. The first installment of the famed Berlin Trilogy, Low confounded critics and fans at first, sounding completely unlike anything in the previous Bowie canon—or anything else really. Side one consisted of seven razor edge concise future-pop numbers bookended by two instrumentals, album opener Speed of Life and side one closer A New Career in a New Town. Side two was comprised of four hypnotic ambient pieces, beginning with the 6+ minute Bowie/Eno composition Warszawa. In an interview for French radio, Bowie said, "Berlin has the strange ability to make you write only the important things. Anything else you don't mention… and in the end you produce Low." Surrealism and experimentation were the themes of the day, and Low's incorporation of these techniques into previously uncharted musical territory is now recognized as the beginning of yet another creative peak for Bowie—and one that has yielded a pair of beloved singles as well, namely Sound and Vision and Be My Wife.<br><br>
                    
                    The second in this triptych, "Heroes" prominently features Robert Fripp on guitar, and a more optimistic outlook overall—evident immediately from the opening build and release of first track Beauty and the Beast, the equally rocking Joe The Lion and Blackout, and the dark alluring postpunk ballad Sons of the Silent Age. The title track is one of Bowie's greatest singles and arguably one of the all-time classic musical love stories, recounting a forbidden liaison between lovers near the Berlin Wall over 6+ minutes of sheer motorik beauty and Fripp's plaintive and hypnotic guitar signature. As with Low, side two of "Heroes" is dominated by mostly instrumental material, yet even that five-song suite featured the major chords of V-2 Schneider as contrast to the somber Sense of Doubt. "Heroes" ended on an upbeat note with The Secret Life of Arabia, one that would foreshadow Bowie's next cultural infatuation.<br><br>
                    
                    Bowie's next foray into film was Just A Gigolo, which he describes as "all my 32 Elvis Presley movies rolled into one." March of 1978 found him on tour again for the first time since the Station To Station outing. Stage was released in September 1978, culled from that tour's swing through the United States, and featuring live interpretations of songs from the Berlin period alongside staples from Ziggy Stardust, Young Americans and Station to Station. During a May break from the tour, Bowie narrated Peter and the Wolf with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the first of many children's projects he would consistently support over the years (now out of print, the result was a collectible green-vinyl album). A relocation to Switzerland was to follow, abandoned frequently due to a developing love affair with Indonesia, Africa and the Far East.<br><br>
                    
                    The aptly named Lodger was released in May 1979, completing the Berlin Trilogy with a sonic and lyrical wanderlust that reached further outward than the Cold War Europe of its predecessors. The last of Bowie's 1970s collaborative works with Eno, Lodger was Bowie's first album to feature Adrian Belew on lead guitar across a globetrotting side one opening with Fantastic Voyage's seductive contemplations of potential nuclear apocalypse and closing with Red Sails, a far eastern take on the hypnotic rhythmic pulse of Krautrock. Side two featured classics DJ, Look Back in Anger and the anthemic Boys Keep Swinging, whose chaotic future calm groove was enhanced by switching guitarist Carlos Alomar to drums and drummer Dennis Davis to bass.<br><br>
                    
                    There would be no tour in support of Lodger, though a surprise three-song Saturday Night Live appearance that December stands as one of the most unique and indelible of its kind to this day. Flanked by NYC avant gardists Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias, Bowie performed The Man Who Sold The World rendered immobile in a plastic tuxedo planted in a giant flower pot, TVC15 in a skirt and heels, and Boys Keep Swinging as a floating head green screened onto a (possibly anatomically correct?) puppet. By the time 1979 was winding down, Bowie was again in the studio. Rehearsals also began for his Broadway debut, in the part of The Elephant Man, which opened in September 1980 to rave reviews.<br><br>
